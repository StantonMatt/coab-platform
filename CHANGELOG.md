## Iteration 1: Project Setup (Status: Completed)

**Planned:** 2-3 days
**Actual:** 3 days
**Start Date:** 2025-01-15
**End Date:** 2025-01-18

### What Went Well
- Prisma introspection worked perfectly with existing Supabase schema
- Frontend setup smoother than expected
- All dependencies installed without version conflicts

### Challenges & Blockers
- Supabase connection timeout on first attempt (resolved by checking IP whitelist)
- Had to add connection pooling (not in original plan)
- TypeScript strict mode caught several type errors early

### Deviations from Plan
- Added connection pooling to Prisma client
- Created additional utility function for RUT validation
- Spent extra time on TypeScript configuration

### Notes
- Connection pooling config: `pool: { timeout: 20, max: 5 }`
- RUT validation function moved to shared utils
- Consider documenting TypeScript strict mode setup for team
```
